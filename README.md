# Fidelio Platform

Example config.json:

{
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "Fidelio",
      "name": "Living Room Speakers",
      "host": "Living_Room"
    }
  ]
}

The `host` can be a hostname or ip address.

Note that the name "Speakers" is used in the name for this example instead of something more intuitive like "Philips" or "Music" or "Radio", as Siri has many stronger associations for those words. For instance, including "Music" in the name will cause Siri to launch the built-in Music app.
